A few words about myself 
===========


Well, it's always hard to write about oneself, but I can try and do my best :)

I am a PhD student, currently working at [Télécom Paris][TP] and [EDF][edf] Lab on Explaning Artificial Intelligence for a Smart Home user. Apart from working, my spare time is distributed between running and being lazy, either with friends or in front of video games.

I like to learn things and useless stuff, and share some things that I think are interesting.
